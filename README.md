# Dual colour Line Follower and Maze Solver

## Description:
  
  Above code enables the bot to follow both White and black line e=whenever there is a sudden interchange of colour.
  It is also able to solve a maze constitng of dead end, T jonts, +(plus signed) intersections, etc. Code is modified to take sharp right
  and acute and turns very precisely.
  
## Materials used:

1. Atmega 8 Development board
2. 2 x BO motors
3. Metal Chassis and caster wheel
4. IR sensor array
5. 2 x individual ir sensors
6. Jumpers

## Code:

  Left hand rule used for maze solving.
  There are 2 ir sensors at corner which detects whether to follow white line or to follow black line
  
## Software used:

1. AVR Studio 4
2. HID bootflash
